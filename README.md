**Project for online food booking** <br>
Hello, I am Joe and this is my second project, which is a simple online food ordering website. <br>
This is a really really simple project, because i was just trying new software, frameworks, etc. <br>
I made this project for my college mini project. I did this when i was in my first year.<br>
I have used Python, Flask Framework and used Eclipse IDE. I used Pydev on Eclipse Marketplace to use Python in Eclipse. <br>
I have also used HTML templates, CSS for styling and JavaScript, for actions after button clicking. JavaScript is not used much, but to just experiment with what it does. <br>

# Framework used: Flask <br>
Command:
> pip install Flask

# Framework used: Flask <br>
